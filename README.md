# Repository for Research work 
<p>The repository contains notebooks of different pre-trained CNN models for three different size categories of images:</p>
<ul>
  <li>224x224</li>
  <li>331x331</li>
  <li>512x512</li>
</ul>

<p>The CNN models are tested over COVID-19 dataset that contains images of three categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pneumonia(without covid) chest x-rays</li>
  <li>Covid19 chest x-rays</li>
  <li>Normal chest x-rays</li>
</ul>
